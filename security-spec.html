<h2>Purpose and Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose-and-scope" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This document describes the security architecture of
the Linux guest kernel running inside the TDX guest.</p>
<p>The main security goal of Intel® Trust Domain Extension (Intel® TDX)
technology is to remove the need for a TDX guest to trust the host and
virtual machine manager (VMM). It is important to note that this
security objective is not unique to the TDX architecture, but it is
common across all confidential cloud computing solutions (CCC) (such as
TDX, AMD SEV, etc) and therefore many aspects described below will be
applicable to other CCC technologies.</p>

<h2>Threat model<a class="headerlink" href="#threat-model" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Trusted Computing Base (TCB)
for the Linux TDX SW stack shown in Figure 1 includes the Intel
platform, the TDX module, and the SW stack running inside the TDX guest.</p>

<p>The major security
objectives of the TDX guest kernel security architecture are to help to prevent
privilege escalation as well as kernel data confidentiality/integrity
violations by the untrusted VMM. The denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
towards the TDX guest kernel is out of scope here since
the TDX guest resources are fully under the control of the VMM and are
able to perform DoS towards the TDX guest by default.</p>
<p>The TDX module and the Intel platform help ensure the protection of the TDX
guest memory and registers. However, they cannot protect the TDX guest
from host/VMM attacks that leverage existing communication interfaces
between the host/VMM and the guest:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>TDVMCALL hypercalls (through the TDX-module)</p></li>
<li><p>Shared memory for IO</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The primary goal of the security architecture described below is to help to
protect the TDX Linux guest kernel from attacks from the hypervisor
through these communication interfaces. Additionally, there should not
be any new additional attack vectors introduced towards the TDX Linux
guest kernel (ring 0) from the TDX guest userspace (ring 3). The TDX
guest userspace is omitted from the scope of this threat model. The
threat model does not address any threats made possible by the TDX guest
userspace directly using the above-mentioned interfaces exposed to an
untrusted host/VMM. For example, if the TDX guest userspace enables
debug or test tools that perform MMIO or pci config space reading on
their own but do not carefully validate the input that comes from
untrusted host/VMM, many additional attacks are possible. This threat
model also assumes the KVM/Qemu to be the hypervisor running the
protected TDX guest. As a result, other hypervisors and their hardening
are also out of the scope of this document. Another potential attack
vector that is not covered by this threat model is abusing the Linux
kernel printout and debug routines that can now take parameters directly
from the untrusted host/VMM.</p>
<p>The overall threat mitigation matrix is shown in Table below.</p>

<h2>TDX Linux guest kernel overall hardening methodology<a class="headerlink" href="#tdx-linux-guest-kernel-overall-hardening-methodology" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Document <a class="reference internal" href="tdx-guest-hardening.html#tdx-guest-hardening"><span class="std std-ref">Intel® Trust Domain Extension Guest Linux Kernel Hardening Strategy</span></a> describes the hardening methodology
that is used to perform systematic audits and fuzzing of the communication
interfaces exposed to the malicious hypervisor. This document covers the
kernel subsystems that are relevant to the described threat model and provides
details on their hardening principles. The overall security principle is
that in case of any corruption event, the safest default option is to
raise the kernel panic.</p>
</section>
<section id="device-filter-mechanism">
<span id="sec-device-filter"></span><h2>Device filter mechanism<a class="headerlink" href="#device-filter-mechanism" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>As stated above, the primary goal of the security architecture described
in this document is to help protecting the TDX Linux guest kernel from hypervisor
attacks through TDVMCALL or shared memory communication interfaces.
The detailed description of when these interfaces are used in TDX guest kernel
can be found below in the section <a class="reference internal" href="#tdvmcall-hypercall-based-communication-interfaces">TDVMCALL-hypercall-based communication interfaces</a>,
but our analysis of the kernel code has shown that the biggest users of such
interfaces are device drivers (more than 95%). Every time a driver
performs a port IO or MMIO read, access a pci config space or reads values
from MSRs or CPUIDs, there is a possibility for a malicious hypervisor to
inject a malformed value.</p>
<p>Fortunately, only a small subset of device drivers are required for the TDX guest
operation (for Linux TDX SW reference stack it is a subset of virtio drivers
described in <a class="reference internal" href="#virtio-and-shared-memory">VirtIO and shared memory</a>), so most of the attack surface can
be disabled by creating a small list of allowed device drivers. This is the
main goal of the guest runtime device filter. It allows to define an allow or
deny list for device drivers and prevents non-authorized device driver’s
probe functions from running (note: driver’s init functions are able to execute).
It also automatically sets to ‘shared’ the MSI mailboxes and MMIO mappings of the
authorized device drivers, if the latter ones are created using pci_iomap_* or devm_ioremap*
interfaces. For MMIO mappings created using plain ioremap_* style interface,
a driver code needs to be modified to either use the above mentioned pci_iomap_*/devm_ioremap*
interfaces or a new ioremap_driver_hardened interface that manually sets the
mapping to ‘shared’ also.</p>
<p>Additionally when device filter is enabled (see section <a class="reference internal" href="#kernel-command-line">Kernel command line</a>
on how it can be disabled for debug purpose from the command line), there are
other security mechanisms that are enabled for the TDX guest Linux
kernel, namely Port IO filter is active (see section <a class="reference internal" href="#io-ports">IO ports</a> for details),
ACPI table allow list is enforced (see section <a class="reference internal" href="#bios-supplied-acpi-tables-and-mappings">BIOS-supplied ACPI tables and mappings</a>
for details) and pci config space access from non-authorized device drivers is limited
(see section <a class="reference internal" href="#pci-config-space">PCI config space</a> for details).
If disabling of the device filter or associated mechanisms is
desired for debug purpose, please consult section <a class="reference internal" href="#kernel-command-line">Kernel command line</a> on how
to change configuration of these mechanisms using command line, i.e. modify
allow/deny list of the device filter, modify the list of allowed ACPI tables, etc.</p>
<section id="device-passthrough">
<span id="sec-device-passthrough"></span><h3>Device passthrough<a class="headerlink" href="#device-passthrough" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>In some deployment models it might be desirable to enable a device passthrough
for a TDX guest. In the current TDX 1.0 model, it is only possible via the usage
of a shared memory, i.e. it is not possible to let the devices to access the TDX
guest private memory. As a result, when a new passthrough device is being enabled
for a TDX guest, the corresponding device driver in the TDX guest must be authorised
to run by the device filter mechanism and its MMIO pages must be mapped as shared
for the communication to happen. This can be done using the following kernel command
attribute: <strong>authorize_allow_devs=pci:&lt;ven_id:dev_id&gt;</strong>. However, based on the type of
the interface that device driver uses to create the MMIO mappings, it might not be
possible to automatically share these pages with the host:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If device driver uses <strong>devm_ioremap*()</strong> or <strong>pci_iomap*()</strong>-style interfaces, the
sharing works fine</p></li>
<li><p>If device driver uses a legacy <strong>ioremap*()</strong>-style interfaces, the
sharing won’t work and the corresponding device driver must be changed
to either use the above interfaces or alternatively a dedicated
<strong>ioremap_driver_hardening()</strong> interface that explicitly indicates that an
MMIO mapping must be shared with the host</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to a non-passthrough case, any device driver enabled in the TDX guest
using the above mechanism must be hardened to withstand the attacks from hypervisor
through TDVMCALL or shared memory communication interfaces. Moreover, since
the device passthrough for TDX 1.0 is using shared memory, any data placed in
this memory can be manipulated by the host/hypervisor and must be protected where possible
using application-level security mechanisms, such as encryption and authentication.</p>

<p>TDVMCALLs are used to communicate between the TDX guest and the
host/VMM. The host/VMM can try to attack the TDX guest kernel by
supplying a maliciously crafted input as a response to a TDVMCALL. While
TDVMCALLs are proxied via the TDX module, only a small portion of them
(mainly some CPUIDs and MSRs) are controlled and enforced by the TDX
module. Most of the TDVMCALLs are passed through and their values are
controlled by the host/VMM. Instead of inserting the TDVMCALL directly
in many code paths within the guest kernel, a #VE handler is used as a
primary centralized TDVMCALL invocation place. However, for some cases
TDVMCALL can be also invoked directly to boost the performance
for a certain hot code path. The #VE handler is invoked by the
TDX module for the actions it cannot handle. The #VE handler either
decodes the executed instruction (using the standard Linux x86
instruction decoder) and converts it into a TDVMCALL or rejects it
(panic). The implementation of the #VE handler is simple and does not
require an in-depth security audit or fuzzing since it is not the actual
consumer of the host/VMM supplied untrusted data. However, it does
implement a simple allow list for the port IO filtering (see <a class="reference internal" href="#io-ports">IO ports</a> ).</p>
<section id="mmio">
<span id="sec-mmio"></span><h3>MMIO<a class="headerlink" href="#mmio" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>MMIO is controlled by the untrusted host and handled through #VE for
most cases, or a special fast path through pci iomap for
performance-critical cases. The instructions in the kernel are trusted.
The #VE handler will decode a subset of instructions using the Linux
instruction decoder. We only care about users that read from MMIO.</p>
<section id="kernel-mmio">
<h4>Kernel MMIO<a class="headerlink" href="#kernel-mmio" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>By default, all MMIO regions reside in the TDX guest private memory
are not accessible to the host/VMM. To explicitly share a MMIO region,
the device must be authorized through the device filter framework,
enabling MMIO operations. The handling of the
MMIO input from the untrusted host/VMM must be hardened (see
<a class="reference internal" href="tdx-guest-hardening.html#tdx-guest-hardening"><span class="std std-ref">Intel® Trust Domain Extension Guest Linux Kernel Hardening Strategy</span></a> for more information).</p>
<p>The static code analysis tool should generate a list of all MMIO users
based on use of the standard io.h macros. All portable code should use
these macros. The only known exception to this is the legacy MMIO APIC
direct accesses, which is disabled (see <a class="reference internal" href="#interrupt-handling-and-apic">Interrupt handling and APIC</a> ).</p>

<span id="sec-apic"></span><h3>Interrupt handling and APIC<a class="headerlink" href="#interrupt-handling-and-apic" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>TDX guest must use virtualized x2APIC mode.
Legacy xAPIC (using MMIO) is disabled via special checks in the
guest’s kernel APIC code, as well as enforced by the TDX module.</p>
<p>The x2APIC MSRs are either proxied through the TDVMCALL hypercall
(and handled by the untrusted hypervisor) or handled as access
to a VAPIC page. The later ones are considered trusted, but the
first group requires hardening similar as untrusted MSR access
described in <a class="reference internal" href="#msrs-proxied-through-tdvmcall-and-controlled-by-host">MSRs proxied through TDVMCALL and controlled by host</a>.
For the detailed description on specific x2APIC MSR behavior
please see section 10.9 in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/tdx-module-1.0-public-spec-v0.931.pdf">Intel TDX module architecture specification</a>.</p>
<p>Untrusted VMM can inject both non-NMI interrupts (via posted-interrupt
mechanism) or NMI interrupts. However, TDX module does not allow VMM
injecting interrupt vectors in range 0-30 via posted-interrupt mechanism,
which drastically reduces the exposed attack surface towards the untrusted VMM.
The rest of above interrupts are considered controlled by the host and
therefore the guest kernel code that handles them must be audited and
fuzzed as any other code that receives malicious host input.</p>
<p>IPIs are initiated by triggering TDVMCALL on the x2APIC ICR MSRs. The
host controls the delivery of the IPI, so IPIs might get lost. We need
to make sure all missing IPIs result in panics or stop the operation (in
case the timeout is controlled by the host). This should be already
handled by the normal timeout in smp_call_function*().</p>

<section id="pci-config-space">
<span id="sec-pci-config-space"></span><h3>PCI config space<a class="headerlink" href="#pci-config-space" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The host controls the PCI config space, so in general, any PCI config
space reads are untrusted. Apart from hardening the generic PCI code, there
is a special pci config space filter that prevents random initcalls from
accessing the PCI config space of unauthorized devices
not allowed by the device filter. The config space filter is implemented
by setting unauthorized devices to the “errored” state, which prevents
any config space accesses.</p>
<p>Inside Linux, the PCI config space is used by several entities:</p>
<section id="pci-subsystem-for-probing-drivers">
<h4>PCI subsystem for probing drivers<a class="headerlink" href="#pci-subsystem-for-probing-drivers" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The PCI subsystem enumerates all PCI devices through PCI config space. The
host owns the config space, which is untrusted. We only support
probing through CF8 and disable MCFG config space via the ACPI table allow list.
This implies that only the first 256 bytes are supported for now. The core PCI
subsystem code has been hardened via code audit and fuzzing described in <a class="reference internal" href="tdx-guest-hardening.html#tdx-guest-hardening"><span class="std std-ref">Intel® Trust Domain Extension Guest Linux Kernel Hardening Strategy</span></a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="allocating-resources">
<h4>Allocating resources<a class="headerlink" href="#allocating-resources" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The kernel can allocate resources such as MMIO for pci bridges or
drivers based on the information coming from the untrusted pci config
space supplied by the host/VMM. Therefore, this allocation process needs
to be verified to withstand the potential malicious input. As a result,
the code in the core pci subsystem, as well as enabled virtio drivers
have been audited and fuzzed using the techniques described in <a class="reference internal" href="tdx-guest-hardening.html#tdx-guest-hardening"><span class="std std-ref">Intel® Trust Domain Extension Guest Linux Kernel Hardening Strategy</span></a>.
Specifically, we paid attention to make sure that the allocated resource
regions do not overlap with each other or with the rest of the TD guest
memory.</p>

<section id="drivers">
<h4>Drivers<a class="headerlink" href="#drivers" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>All allow-listed drivers need to be audited and fuzzed for all pci config space
interactions they have with the host. Initially this is only a very small list
of virtio devices (see <a class="reference internal" href="#virtio-and-shared-memory">VirtIO and shared memory</a>).</p>
</section>
<section id="user-programs-accessing-pci-config-space">
<h4>User programs accessing PCI config space<a class="headerlink" href="#user-programs-accessing-pci-config-space" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>User programs can access PCI devices directly through sysfs or /dev/mem.
This could be an attack vector if the user program has an exploitable
hole in parsing PCI config space or MMIO. If the user programs are using the
Linux-supplied PCI enumeration (/sys/bus/pci), the PCI device allow list
will protect user programs to some degree. But it won’t protect programs
that try to directly access devices that are on the allow list (like
virtio devices).</p>
<p>It’s also possible, for userspace programs to access the PCI config space directly
through CF8 port IO using operm/iopl() or direct read() on /dev/port. The former
case will be filtered in the TDX guest kernel #VE handler, because the handler does not
forward port IO requests to an untrusted VMM if the request came from a userspace.
The latter case (direct read on /dev/port) however is not going to be limited by
the #VE handler and a userspace program that performs this operation should be
prepared to handle untrusted input from a VMM securely. PCI config space access
through MMIO for userspace programs is not possible inside TDX guest since PCIe MCFG
config space is disabled for TDX guest and normal PCI config space is not mapped to
MMIO address space.</p>

Some additional MSRs are in arch/x86/include/asm/perf_event.h,

<section id="msrs-controlled-by-tdx-module">
<h4>MSRs controlled by TDX module<a class="headerlink" href="#msrs-controlled-by-tdx-module" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>There are two types of MSRs that are controlled by the TDX module:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Passthrough MSRs (direct read/write from the CPU, for example side
channel related MSRs, such as ARCH_CAPABILITIES)</p></li>
<li><p>Disallowed MSRs that result in #GP upon attempt to read/write
such an MSR (for example, all IA32_VMX_* KVM MSRs).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All these MSRs are controlled by the platform, are trusted, and do not
require any hardening. See section 18.1 in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/tdx-module-1.0-public-spec-v0.931.pdf">Intel TDX module architecture specification</a> for the exact list.</p>

<section id="msrs-proxied-through-tdvmcall-and-controlled-by-host">
<h4>MSRs proxied through TDVMCALL and controlled by host<a class="headerlink" href="#msrs-proxied-through-tdvmcall-and-controlled-by-host" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Access to these MSRs typically results in a #VE event inserted by the TDX module
back to the TDX guest, and the TDX guest kernel #VE handler invoking the TDVMCALL
hypercall to the untrusted VMM to obtain/set these MSR values. In some cases
for performance reasons the TDVMCALL hypercall is invoked directly from TDX guest
kernel to avoid an additional context switch to the TDX module.
All these MSRs are considered untrusted and their handling in the TDX guest kernel
must be hardened, i.e., audited and fuzzed using the methodology described in
<a class="reference internal" href="tdx-guest-hardening.html#tdx-guest-hardening"><span class="std std-ref">Intel® Trust Domain Extension Guest Linux Kernel Hardening Strategy</span></a>.</p>
<p>Based on our fuzzing and auditing activities, the risk for the memory
safety issues based on MSR values is considered to be low, since most of the MSRs
are handled via masking individual MSR bits, i.e., saving and restoring MSR bit values.
However, some MSRs control rather complex functionality, such as
IA32_MC*, IA32_MTRR_*, IA32_TME_*.
We have disabled most of such features to minimize the exposed attack
surface via clearing the following feature bits during TDX guest early
initialization: X86_FEATURE_MCE, X86_FEATURE_MTRR, X86_FEATURE_TME.
For the full up-to-date list, please check tdx_early_init() function.
Should these feature need to be enabled, a detailed code audit and fuzzing
approach must be used to ensure the respective code is hardened.</p>

<p>All IO port accesses go through #VE or direct TDVMCALLs. We’ll use a

inject old ISA drivers that use port probing and might have
vulnerabilities processing port data. While normally these cannot be

standard port probing.</p>

<p>For various performance enhancements KVM provides a number of PV features

define respected KVM hypercalls, and some are using other means for communication:
MSRs, memory structures, etc. Each of such features is under full control of
the host and should be considered untrusted. KVM hypercalls are proxied through
TDVMCALL in TDX case. For the full list of KVM features and hypercalls please consult

and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/virt/kvm/hypercalls.rst">KVM hypercalls description</a> .</p>
<p>Based on our security analysis (see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/intel/ccc-linux-guest-hardening/issues/152">Security implications from KVM PV features</a>
for more information), only the KVM_FEATURE_CLOCKSOURCE(2) CPUIDs
should be explicitly disabled in the guest kernel, since it would allow the
guest to rely on host-controlled kvmclock for providing the timing information. The disabling
can be done via “no-kvmclock” guest kernel cmdline option.
The rest of features do not require explicit disabling, because they
either considered not to have any security implications towards the TDX
guest (apart from DoS) or already indirectly disabled (KVM_FEATURE_ASYNC_PF,
KVM_FEATURE_PV_EOI, KVM_FEATURE_STEAL_TIME) because the required memory structures

<p>Most of the above CPUID leaves result in different feature bits and
therefore are harmless. The ones that have larger fields have been
audited and fuzzed in the same way as other untrusted inputs from the
hypervisor. In addition, it is also possible to sanitize multi-bit
CPUIDs against the bounds expected for a given platform.</p>
<p>However, to strengthen security even further, the #VE handler in TDX
guest kernel has been recently modified to only allow leaves in the
range 0x40000000 - 0x400000FF to be requested from the untrusted host/VMM.
If SW inside TDX guest tries to read any other leaf from the above table,
the value of 0 is returned.</p>
<p>Going forward TDX module introduced a new TDX guest feature, called REDUCE_VE
(for details consult latest <a class="reference external" href="https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/733575">Intel TDX module architecture specification</a>).
If this feature is enabled by the TDX guest, all CPUID leaves from the above table
except the reserved ones (0x80000005, 0x40000000- 0x400000FF) won’t result in a #VE
insertion and will contain the values predefined or calculated by TDX module and
therefore can be considered trusted. This helps reduce the issues resulting from
#VE Linux kernel handler returning the value of “0” on these leaves.</p>

<p>TDX has a limited secure time with the TSC timer. The TSC inside a TD is
guaranteed to be synchronized and monotonous, but not necessarily
matching real time. A guest can turn it into truly secure wall time by
using a remote authenticated time server. This is the recommended way of
obtaining the secure time inside a TDX guest. In the absence of a
remote authenticated server, TDX guest gets the time from Linux RTC.
However, Linux RTC has not yet been hardened and its usage presents a
potential security threat.</p>
<p>By default, for the KVM hypervisor, kvmclock would have priority, which
is not secure anymore because it uses untrusted input from the host. To
avoid this the kvmclock must be disabled by using ‘no-kvmclock’ cmdline
option (command line is measured and can be attested).
Additionally, the TSC watchdog is also disabled (by
forcing the X86_FEATURE_TSC_RELIABLE bit) to avoid the possible
fallback to jiffy time, which could be influenced by the host by
changing the frequency of the timer interrupts.</p>
<p>The TSC deadline timer inside the TDX guest is not secure and fully under
the control of host/VMM. The TSC deadline feature enumeration (CPUID(1).ECX[24])
inside the TDX guest reports the platform native value, but the TDX guest kernel
reads or writes to MSR_IA32_TSC_DEADLINE will result in a #VE
inserted to the guest and in a subsequent TDVMCALL to VMM. On such a call the VMM starts
an LAPIC timer to emulate tsc deadline timer and inject a posted interrupt
to the TDX guest when the timer expires.</p>

<h2>Declaring insecurity to user space<a class="headerlink" href="#declaring-insecurity-to-user-space" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many of the security measures described in this document can be disabled
with command line arguments, especially any kind of filtering. While
such a configuration change is detected by attestation, there are use
cases that don’t use full attestation and may continue running even if
it fails.</p>
<p>For this purpose, a taint flag TAINT_CONF_NO_LOCKDOWN is set when any
command line overrides for lockdowns are used. The user agent could
check that by using /proc/sys/kernel/taint. Additionally, there are
warnings printed to indicate whenever the device filter has been
disabled, overridden over command line, etc.</p>
<p>The key server helps to ensure through attestation that the guest runs in secure
mode. It does that by attesting the kernel command line, as well as the
kernel binary. The kernel configuration should include module signing,
which can be enforced by the command line as well as the binary.</p>

<section id="bios-supplied-acpi-tables-and-mappings">
<span id="sec-acpi-tables"></span><h2>BIOS-supplied ACPI tables and mappings<a class="headerlink" href="#bios-supplied-acpi-tables-and-mappings" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>ACPI table mappings and similar table mappings use the ioremap_cache
interface, which is never set to ‘shared’ with the untrusted host/VMM.
However, in order to be able to share operating regions declared in
ACPI tables a new interface ioremap_cache_shared is introduced. This
interface sets the pages to shared and is currently only used by the
acpi system memory address space handler (acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler).
Note that this means that any operating region declared in the allow
list of TDX guest kernel ACPI tables is going to be set to ‘shared’ automatically.
This further motivates keeping the allowed ACPI table list in TDX guest
to a minimum required amount, and auditing the content of the allowed
tables. Ideally it would be more secure to only share operating regions
of drivers authorized by the device filter. However, since ACPI core doesn’t
have a mapping between operating region addresses and the drivers that requested it,
this change has been proven to be too intrusive.</p>
<p>ACPI tables are (mostly) controlled by the host and only passed through
the TDVF (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/tdx-virtual-firmware-design-guide-rev-1.01.pdf">TDX guest virtual firmware</a> for more information).
They are measured into TDX attestation registers, and therefore can be
remotely attested and therefore can be considered trusted. However, we
cannot expect that an attesting entity fully understands what causes the
Linux kernel to open security holes based on some particular AML. Then a
malicious hypervisor might be able to attack the guest based on attack
surfaces exposed by the non-malicious and attested ACPI tables. The main
concern here is the tables and methods that configure some functionality
in the kernel, such as initializing drivers.</p>
<p>As a first step to minimize the above attack surface, the TDX guest
kernel defines an allow list for the ACPI tables. Currently the list
includes the following tables: XSDT, FACP, DSDT, FACS, APIC, and SVKL.
However, it still includes large tables like DSDT that contain a lot of
functionality. Ideally one would need to define a minimal set of methods
that such table needs to support and then perform a code audit and
fuzzing of these methods. All features that are not required (for
example CPPC throttling) should be disabled to minimize the attack
surface. This hardening activity has not been performed for the TDX
guest and remains a future task. Alternatively, for a more generic
hardening in-depth approach, the whole ACPI interpreter can be fuzzed
and hardened, but this is a considerable effort and also is left for the
future. For example, one possible future hardening is to add some range
checking in ACPI to not write from AML to memory outside MMIO.</p>

<section id="tdx-guest-private-memory-page-management">
<h2>TDX guest private memory page management<a class="headerlink" href="#tdx-guest-private-memory-page-management" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>All TDX guest private memory pages are allocated by the host and must be
explicitly “accepted” into the guest using the TDG.MEM.PAGE.ACCEPT command. The TDX
guest kernel needs to make sure that an already accepted page is not
accepted again, because doing so would change the content of the guest
private page to a zero page with possible security implications (zeroing
out keys, secrets, etc.). Additionally, per current design of the TDX
module, certain events (like TDX guest memory access to a non-accepted page)
can result in a #VE event inserted by the TDX guest module. Please see section 16.3.3 in
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/tdx-module-1.0-public-spec-v0.931.pdf">Intel TDX module architecture specification</a> for more details.
The guest kernel must always check the cause of a #VE event and panic if
it sees a #VE event that is caused by access to a TDX guest private page.
If this check is not implemented, it opens a TDX guest to many attacks against
the content of the TDX guest private memory.
For the Linux guest kernel specifically, it is also very important that such #VE notifications do
not happen during certain TDX guest critical code paths. The section <a class="reference internal" href="#safety-against-ve-in-kernel-code">Safety against #VE in kernel code</a>
provides more details, as well as describes how Linux guest kernel avoids
#VE events altogether.</p>
<section id="tdvf-conversion">
<h3>TDVF conversion<a class="headerlink" href="#tdvf-conversion" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most of the initial memory for the TDX guest is converted by the TDVF
and the TDX guest kernel can use all this memory through the normal UEFI
memory map. However, due to performance implications, it is not possible
to pre-accept all memory required for a guest to run, so the lazy memory
accept logic described the next section is used.</p>
</section>
<section id="lazy-conversion">
<h3>Lazy conversion<a class="headerlink" href="#lazy-conversion" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>To address the significant performance implications of pre-accepting all
the pages, the pages will be accepted in runtime as required. Once VMM
adds a private memory page to a TDX guest, its secure EPT entry resides
in the PENDING state before the TDX guest explicitly accepts this page
(secure EPT entry moves to PRESENT state) using the TDG.MEM.PAGE.ACCEPT
instruction.</p>
<p>According to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/tdx-module-1.0-public-spec-v0.931.pdf">Intel TDX module architecture specification</a>, if the TDX guest attempts to
accept the page that is already in the PRESENT state (essentially do a
double accept by chance), then the TDX module has a way to detect this
and supply a warning, so accepting an already accepted page is OK.</p>
<p>However, it is possible that that malicious host/VMM can execute the
sequence of TDH.MEM.RANGE.BLOCK; TDH.MEM.TRACK; and TDH.MEM.PAGE.REMOVE
calls on any present private page. Then it can quickly add it back with
TDH.MEM.PAGE.AUG, and it goes into pending state. If the guest does not
verify that it has previously accepted this page and accepts it again,
it would end up using a zero page instead of data it previously had
there. So, re-accept can happen if there is no TDX guest internal
tracking of which pages have been previously accepted. For this purpose,
the TDX guest kernel keeps track of already accepted pages in a 2MB
granularity bitmap allocated in decompressor. In turn the page allocator
accepts 2MB chunks as needed.</p>

<section id="safety-against-ve-in-kernel-code">
<h3>Safety against #VE in kernel code<a class="headerlink" href="#safety-against-ve-in-kernel-code" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The TDX guest Linux kernel needs to make sure it does not get #VE in certain critical
sections. One example of such a section is a system call gap: on
SYSCALL/SYSRET. There is a small instruction window where the kernel
runs with the user stack pointer. If a #VE event (for example due to a
malicious hypervisor removing a memory page as explained in the above
section) happens in that window, it would allow a malicious userspace
(ring 3) process in the guest to take over the guest kernel. As a result,
it must be ensured that it is not possible to get a #VE event on the
pages containing kernel code or data.</p>
<p>Such #VE events are currently possible in two cases:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>TD guest accesses a private GPA for which the Secure EPT entry is in PENDING state and ATTRIBUTES.SEPT_VE_DISABLE TD guest attribute is not set.</p></li>
<li><p>TDX module can raise a #VE as a notification mechanism when it detects excessive Secure EPT violations raised by the same TD instruction (zero-step attack is detected by TDX module). This is only done if bit 0 of TDCS.NOTIFY_ENABLES field is set.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To ensure the above situations do not occur, the TD Linux guest kernel
performs the following during kernel initialization:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Checks that ATTRIBUTES.SEPT_VE_DISABLE is set and panic otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Forcefully clear the TDCS.NOTIFY_ENABLES bit 0 regardless of its state.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Although the later check disables TDX module notifications for excessive numbers
of Secure EPT violations, the basic defenses against zero-stepping
provided by the TDX module are still in effect.
For more details please see section 16.3 in
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/tdx-module-1.0-public-spec-v0.931.pdf">Intel TDX module architecture specification</a></p>

<section id="reliable-panic">
<h2>Reliable panic<a class="headerlink" href="#reliable-panic" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In various situations when the TDX guest kernel detects a potential
security problem, it needs to reliably stop. Standard panic performs
many complex actions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>IPIs to other CPUs to stop them. This is not secure because the IPI
is controlled by the host, which could choose not to execute them.</p></li>
<li><p>There can be notifiers to other drivers and subsystems which can do
complex actions, including something that would cause the panic to
wait for a host action.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As a result, it is not possible to guarantee that any other VCPU is
reliably stopped with the standard panic and therefore a reliable panic
is required. There is a potential path to make the panic more atomic
(prevent reentry), but not fully atomic (due to TDX module limitations).
This remains to be a direction for future work.</p>

<section id="kernel-and-initrd-loading">
<h2>Kernel and initrd loading<a class="headerlink" href="#kernel-and-initrd-loading" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In a simple reference configuration the TDVF loads the kernel,
the initrd, and a startup script from an
unencrypted UEFI VFAT volume in the guest storage area through virtio.
The startup script contains the kernel command line. The kernel is
booted through the Linux UEFI stub. Before booting the TDVF runs hashes
over the kernel image/initrd/startup script and attest those to a key
server through the TDX measurement registers.</p>
</section>
<section id="kernel-command-line">
<span id="sec-kernel-cmd"></span><h2>Kernel command line<a class="headerlink" href="#kernel-command-line" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The kernel command line will allow to run an insecure kernel by
disabling various security features or injecting unsafe code. However,
we assume that the kernel command line is trusted, which is ensured by
measuring its contents by the TDVF into TDX attestation registers.</p>
<p>The following command options are currently supported by TD guest kernel:</p>
<p>1. <strong>tdx_disable_filter</strong>. This option completely turns off the TDX
device filter: guest kernel will allow loading of arbitrary device drivers
in this mode. Additionally, a lot of explicitly disabled functionally
(like pci quirks, enhanced pci capabilities, pci bridge support and others),
will no longer be disabled and the respected unhardened linux guest code
becomes reachable for the interaction with an untrusted host/VMM.
For more detailed information on what functionality is guarded by the TDX
device filter, see conditional checks cc_platform_has(CC_ATTR_GUEST_DEVICE_FILTER)
in the kernel source code. Note that the port IO filter is also disabled in this mode.
As a result, passing tdx_disable_filter option via TD guest command line
enables a lot of unhardened code in the attack surface between an untrusted
host/VMM and TDX Linux guest kernel. The remote attester must always verify
that this option has not been used to start a TDX guest kernel via the TDX
attestation quote.</p>
<p>2. <strong>authorize_allow_devs=</strong>. This option allows to specify a list of allowed
devices in addition to the explicit list specified by TDX filter. However,
this option is only intended for the debug purpose and should not be used
in production since there is a high risk to enable devices this way that
haven’t been hardened to withstand a potentially malicious host input.
Instead, when a new device needs to be added to the TDX filter default allow
list, the steps from <a class="reference external" href="https:TBD">Enabling additional kernel drivers</a> must
be followed.</p>
<p>3. <strong>tdx_allow_acpi=</strong>. This option allows passing additional allowed acpi
tables to the default list specified in the TDX filter. Similarly, as the
above option, it should be only used for the debug purpose. If an
additional acpi table needs to be used in TDX guest, it should be included
in the default TDX filter list after a security audit and risk assessment.</p>
<p>Additionally, to minimize the attack surface the following cmdline options
are strongly recommended for TDX guests:</p>

<section id="storage-protection">
<h2>Storage protection<a class="headerlink" href="#storage-protection" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The confidentiality and authenticity of the TD guest disk volume’s needs
to be protected from the host/VMM that handles it. The exact protection
method is decided by the TD tenant, but we provide a default reference
setup. We use dmcrypt with LUKS with dm integrity to provide encryption
and authentication for the storage volumes. To retrieve the decryption
key during the TD boot process, the TD guest initrd contains an agent
that performs the TD attestation to a remote key server. The attestation
quote is going to contain the measurements from the TDVF, the boot
loader, kernel, its command line, and initrd itself. The actual
communication protocol between the remote key server and the initrd
attestation agent will be customer (cloud) specific. The reference
initrd attestation agent provided by Intel implements the Intel
reference protocol. After the attestation succeeds, the initrd
attestation agent obtains the key and it is used by the initrd to mount
the TD guest file system.</p>
<p>Users could use other encryption schemes for storage, such as not using
LUKS but some other encrypted storage format. Alternatively, they could
also not use local storage and rely on a volume mounted from the network
after attesting themselves to the network server. However, support for
such remote storage is out of the scope for this document for now.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: Commonly used read/write Linux storage protection methods (including
dmcrypt and dm integrity) do not provide rollback protection.
If rollback attacks are a concern, the networking-based storage outside
of attacker control is the recommended option. The absence of rollback
protection also has implications on guest private memory rollback attacks
if memory swapping to the filesystem is enabled in the guest kernel.
Due to this limitation, we recomend disabling guest memory swap.</p>

<section id="virtio-and-shared-memory">
<span id="sec-virtio"></span><h2>VirtIO and shared memory<a class="headerlink" href="#virtio-and-shared-memory" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The virtIO subsystem is controlled by the untrusted host/VMM. For the
application data transferred over the virtIO communication channel, its
confidentiality and integrity (and rollback when required) must be
guaranteed by the application-level mechanisms. For example, virtio block
IO can be encrypted and authenticated using dmcrypt or other similar mechanism,
virtio network communication can use TLS or similar for the transmitted data.
Please also note that for host visible consoles, like virtio-console, there
is no existing method to protect the application data due to functional nature
of the console. For the production systems, we only recommend enabling network
console over ssh or similar.</p>
<p>All the rest of virtio input received from the host/VMM must be considered
untrusted. We need to make sure the that the core virtio code and
enabled virtio drivers are hardened against the malicious inputs
received from host/VMM through exposed interfaces, such as pci config
space and shared memory.</p>
<p>The virtIO subsystem is also highly configurable with different options
possible for the virtual queue’s types, transportation, etc. For the
virtual queues, currently the only mode that was hardened (by performing
code audit and fuzzing activities outlined in <a class="reference internal" href="tdx-guest-hardening.html#tdx-guest-hardening"><span class="std std-ref">Intel® Trust Domain Extension Guest Linux Kernel Hardening Strategy</span></a>)
is a split virtqueue without indirect descriptor support, so this mode is the only
one recommended for the secure virtio communication. For the virtio
transportation, the Linux TDX guest kernel uses hardened virtio over PCI
transport and disables the virtio over MMIO. If virtio over MMIO support
is desired, it can be enabled given that the hardening of this mode is
performed. For the virtio over PCI, we also disable the
virtio-pci-legacy mode and only harden the virtio-pci-modern mode. For
some of above described virtio configurations (for example disabling the
virtio-pci-legacy mode), it is possible for the TDX guest userspace to
override the secure defaults (given enough privileges). But doing so
would open the unhardened code and is strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>VirtIO drivers are built around the virtio ring. The ring contains
descriptors, which are organized in a free list. The free list handling
has been recently hardened by moving out of the shared memory into
guest private memory. We assume the main attack point is the ring,
but we also harden the higher-level
enabled drivers such as virtio-block, virtio-net, virtio-console,
virtio-9p, and virtio-vsock. All other virtio drivers are disabled by
the TDX guest driver filter and are not hardened.</p>
<p>VirtIO accesses the pci config space by using virtio-specific pci config
space access functions that are part part of both code audit and fuzzing
activities. Most of the virtio shared memory accesses go through
virtio_to_cpu macros and their higher-level wrappers, which are also
used for auditing and injecting the fuzzing input. However, there still
can be other accesses to the shared memory that must be manually audited
and instrumented for fuzzing.</p>

is a class of transient execution attack (also known as Spectre V1),
which typically requires an attacker who can control an offset used
during a speculative
read or write. For the classical attack surface between the
userspace and the OS kernel (ring 3 &lt;-&gt; ring 0), an adversary has
several ways to provide the necessary controlled inputs to the OS
kernel, i.e., via system call parameters, routines to copy data
between the userspace and the OS kernel, and others.</p>
<p>While a TDX guest VM is no different from a legacy guest VM in
terms of protecting this userspace &lt;-&gt; OS kernel boundary, an
adversary who controls the (untrusted)
host/VMM can provide inputs to a TDX guest kernel via a wider range of
interfaces. Examples of such interfaces include shared memory as well
as the <a class="reference internal" href="#tdvmcall-hypercall-based-communication-interfaces">TDVMCALL-hypercall-based communication interfaces</a> described
above.
A Linux kernel running inside a TDX guest should take additional
measures to mitigate any potential Spectre v1 gadgets involving such
interfaces.</p>
<p>To facilitate the task of identifying potential Spectre v1 gadgets in the new
attack surface between an untrusted host/VMM &lt;-&gt; TDX guest Linux kernel, the <a class="reference external" href="http://smatch.sourceforge.net/">Smatch</a> static analyzer can be used.
It has an existing <a class="reference external" href="https://repo.or.cz/smatch.git/blob/HEAD:/check_spectre.c">check_spectre.c</a>
pattern that has been recently enhanced to find potential Spectre v1 gadgets
on the data that can be influenced by an untrusted host/VMM using
<a class="reference internal" href="#tdvmcall-hypercall-based-communication-interfaces">TDVMCALL-hypercall-based communication interfaces</a> interfaces, such as MSR,
CPUID, PortIO, MMIO and PCI config space read functions, as well as virtio-based
shared memory read functions.</p>
<p>In order to configure the pattern to perform the Spectre v1 gadget
analysis on the host data, the following environmental variable must
be set prior to running the smatch analysis:</p>
<blockquote>

</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>To revert to the original behavior of the pattern, i.e.,
identification of Spectre v1 gadgets from userspace-induced inputs,
the same variable needs to be unset:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">unset</span><span class="w"> </span>ANALYZE_HOST_DATA

<p>Each reported item needs to be manually analyzed to determine if it is
a potential Spectre v1 gadget or a false positive. To minimize the
number of entries for manual analysis, the list in smatch_warns.txt
should be filtered against a list of drivers that are allowed for the
TDX guest kernel, since most of the potential reported Spectre v1
gadgets are going to be related to various x86 Linux kernel drivers.
The process_smatch_output.py script can be used for doing the
automatic filtering of the results, but its list of allowed drivers
needs to be adjusted to reflect the TDX guest kernel under analysis.
For the items that are determined to be potential Spectre v1 gadgets
during the manual analysis phase, the recommended mitigations listed
